    <h1> My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h1> Singing</h1>
    <p>Right from my childhood, I used to love songs and I used to listen to many different kinds of songs. Then when I started picking up on the lyrics, my parents realized that I really had a passion for music. Music classes were searched and finally I was being put to one, under a well-trained teacher. From then on, I never looked back. I was taught from the basics to Carnatic, western, light music and so on. I just fell in love with music each time I learnt something new. The training did help me to get my vocals and modulations right and this enabled me to take part in various competitions that came up, during my childhood.</p>
